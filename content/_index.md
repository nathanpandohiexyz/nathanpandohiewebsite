title: "Hey, I'm Nathan."
description: "I'm passionate about **software**, **operating systems**, **online privacy**, and **all things tech-related**. I enjoy **reading** and am **currently learning coding and web development**. I'm also **considering starting my own YouTube channel in the future**\n\n
This website is meant to be my **\"home base\"** on the internet. I'll post some thoughts about things I'm interested in, whether it's about desktop Linux, building minimalistic websites, or books I'm currently reading.<br />  


This website is based on [Eric Murphy's website](https://ericmurphy.xyz). As you can see, the layout and content is very similar, and sometimes, such as the paragraph right above this one, content is completely copied from his website. Many more things that he has that I also like are on here, but many of them are edited for my needs. Permission to do this has been obtained from Eric Murphy's [Uncopyright page](https://ericmurphy.xyz/uncopyright)."
